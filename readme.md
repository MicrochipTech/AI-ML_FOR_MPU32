# Machine Learning applications for Microchip's 32-bits microprocessors

This repository is dedicated to the machine learning applications created on the [latests MPU32s](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/products/microcontrollers-and-microprocessors/32-bit-mpus).


## MPU32s and evaluation kits supported

Only one board is supported for the moment :

| Evaluation Kit      | Architecture | 
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [SAMA7G54-Ek](sama7g54-ek)      | Arm Cortex-A7

## Customize Linux4SAM Distribution for Machine Learning. 

To generate your own Linux4SAM image, you will need to customize the Linux4Sam Buildroot distribution. 

To do so, follow the instructions provided in the [linux4sam_for_ml](linux4sam_for_ml) directory.
